                    <p>I can babble on about my academic achievements and my zeal for self-improvement in all aspects of my life, but what better way to demonstrate the point than with an example.</p>
                    <p>The implications of lockdown loomed over us all in different ways. For me, it meant that I had stayed locked in doors for months on end. Granted, it did bless me with the time to self-reflect and realise the newly found hobby of programming which I now plan to pursue as a career, it wasn’t all good news. Let’s just say being locked up at home for too long does not do wonders for your physical or mental well-being. </p>
                    <p>In the spirit of self-improvement, a few months ago I had decided to challenge myself to go out for a 10km jog 6am every morning for the rest of this year. Some mornings were dark, many were cold, some even rainy, and even with the regular feeling of soreness, I have successfully gone out every morning without fail and will continue to do so until the end of the year.</p>
                    <p>Quite recently, I have also challenged myself to become a full stack web developer in the space of a few months. I have no intention of quitting! </p>
